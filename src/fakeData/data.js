The autopsy identified the following:<br />- Prosthetic right eye<br />- 10-inch long, well-healed scar on his mid-left abdominal wall<br />- Left kidney had been surgically removed<br />- Benign tumor beneath his sternum/breastbone<br />- Coronary artery disease<br />- Signs of emphysema<br />- Gallbladder contained three large stones<br />It is likely these medical conditions had been diagnosed by a doctor and may have been known by those close to him.

Raush was reported missing on January 31, 2014, when his significant other was unable to locate him. Raush suffers from mental illness and has had contact with law enforcement on multiple occasions due to mental health episodes. Some of this law enforcement contact occurred on highways and near railroad tracks while Philip was on foot. Record checks indicate law enforcement agencies in Southern California queried Raush between January 2, 2014, and October 17, 2014, but the reasons for these queries and whether Raush was physically present at the time are unknown. Investigators have utilized Raush\u2019s name and social security in efforts to locate him in a mental health or corrections facility to no avail. Investigators ask that all agencies review their cases to identify any possible contact with an individual matching the description of Raush.</p>",

        '<p>On June 5, 1991, the body of an unidentified female was found in a room at the Super 8 Motel located near I-40 and I-25 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, after checkout was not competed as scheduled.</p>\r\n<p>There was no identification for the woman with her belongings. She wore a "Trends"-brand multi-colored (white, pink, red, and yellow) tank top; size 31 "Guess Product by George Marciano" white denim pants; three-inch silver hoop earrings; and a wide metal bracelet. A dark-colored purse and suitcase with women\'s clothing were also found in the room.</p>\r\n<p>Based on a recent tip, investigators believe the woman\'s name "Becca." She was reportedly from the Los Angeles County area (possibly Reseda or Sylmar, California) and flew from either Los Angeles or Burbank, California, to Albuquerque.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to contact the Albuquerque Police Department.</p>',

Greenes allegedly made false statements to obtain loans or increase existing loans for the companies, including displaying inflated company assets, sales, and accounts receivable information which he knew were significantly less than the amounts represented on documents submitted to the financial institutions. Most of the purported inventory and accounts receivables of Mizrahi\'s companies did not exist and some of the accounts payable were non-existent. The companies\' inventory was auctioned off, but the proceeds only resolved or repaid a small amount of the loans.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>A federal arrest warrant was issued for Greenes in the United States District Court, Central District of California, on January 30, 2014, after he was charged with bank fraud, false statements to a federally insured financial institution, aiding and abetting, and causing an act to be done.</p>',
